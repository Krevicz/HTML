      <h2>Why are cats such a popular pet?</h2>
      <p>
        Affectionate and Compassionate: Cats are known for their gentle and
        loving nature. They are often described as "kittens" when they are
        young, which implies that they are cute and cuddly. This makes them
        highly appealing to people who value emotional connection and
        companionship.
