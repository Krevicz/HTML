        <p class="paragraphs">
          The history of computers spans several centuries, beginning with early
          mechanical devices like the abacus and Charles Babbage's 19th-century
          Analytical Engine, which is considered a precursor to modern
          computers. The 20th century saw the advent of electronic computers,
          starting with vacuum tube-based machines such as the ENIAC, followed
          by the invention of transistors and integrated circuits, which
          revolutionized computing power and efficiency. The introduction of
          microprocessors in the 1970s marked the era of personal computers,
          making computing accessible to individuals and businesses alike. As
          technology advanced, computers evolved from bulky, room-sized machines
          to sleek, powerful devices embedded in virtually every aspect of daily
          life, driving innovation and transforming industries across the globe.

        <h2 class="headings">How computers have evolved</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          Computers have undergone remarkable evolution since their inception,
          transitioning from massive, room-filling machines to compact, highly
          efficient devices. Early computers like the ENIAC used vacuum tubes
          and were limited in both size and functionality. The development of
          transistors and integrated circuits in the mid-20th century
          dramatically reduced the size of computers while increasing their
          power and reliability. The advent of microprocessors in the 1970s
          ushered in the personal computer era, making computing accessible to
          individuals and small businesses. In recent decades, advancements in
          semiconductor technology, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence
          have further miniaturized and expanded the capabilities of computers,
          leading to the proliferation of smartphones, tablets, and wearable
          technology. This ongoing evolution continues to drive innovation,
          shaping the future of how we work, communicate, and interact with the
          world.
