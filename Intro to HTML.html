    I personally love to eat KFC. The reason that I love to eat KFC is because
    it is the best tasting fast food that one can buy at a cheap price and is
    possibly the best fried chicken in the world that is mass produced and easy
    to get within driving distance. The menu at KFC is so diverse, with so many
    options and available choices for vegetarians. The chicken is seasoned so
    beautifully, with spices that dance on your tongue while you eat. There is
    nothing better than a hot, crispy and fresh piece of KFC chicken that is
    cooked to perfection.
