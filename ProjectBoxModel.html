      Did you know that the world's oldest known living tree is a bristlecone
      pine named "Methuselah"? Located in the White Mountains of California,
      Methuselah is over 4,800 years old. These trees are incredibly resilient,
      able to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water, extreme
      temperatures, and nutrient-poor soils. The exact location of Methuselah is
      kept secret to protect it from vandalism and excessive foot traffic,
      allowing this ancient tree to continue thriving in its secluded
      environment.
